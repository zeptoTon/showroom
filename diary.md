What dev stack should I use?
what I learn from masterchef(webpack + babel + react), we could use typescript + react this time.
Nodejs + Express + Jest test runner + Sinon
 - create, update, delete, retrieve
SASS + mobx + typescript + Jest test runner + Sinon
 - bookmark individual character, store on server as well
deploy
 - N/A
database
 - store characters mongodb
 - ORM: mongoose, mongod --dbpath=./data
search
cache

remark:
 - single user problem, cannot allow more than 1 user behaviour
